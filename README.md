# mal-firewall
This repo contains malicious firewall rules for CDT

These rules can be commented out as necessary, however the base functionality to include persistence over https should not be removed

This repo contains a .ps1 and .sh script, which can be used for windows and linux respectively. To use these scripts, simply place on the machine and use ./systemd-conf.sh or .\ps-defaults.ps1
They have been named obscurely to trick blue team :D
